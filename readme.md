# 🏠 Roommate Matcher – Smart Compatibility Based Matching System

A full-stack web application that helps users find compatible roommates based on lifestyle preferences such as sleep schedule, study routine, cleanliness, noise tolerance, budget range, habits, and hostel location.

Instead of random suggestions, the system calculates a smart compatibility score and explains why two users are a good match.
